  <h3 class="title is-2">bindings</h3>
  <p>
    This directory contains files for your custom bindings. Bindings should be a
    directory with the binding's name and contain at least an index.js that exports
    a <code>{ init, update }</code> binding object.
  </p>
  <p>
    Make it a best practice to also include a README.md and test.js for your binding
    in the same directory.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example:

    <pre><code>
      bindings/
      -- fadeIn/
      ---- index.js
      ---- test.js
      ---- README.md  
    </code></pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Bindings in this directory will be loaded automatically
  </p>
