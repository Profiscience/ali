  <p>
    In development, Ali uses the webpack-dev-server to bundle and serve assets from
    memory. Inline sourcemaps are enabled (no "waiting for sourcemaps to load" message in Chrome),
    and optimization and minification is skipped. No DLLs are used.
  </p>
  <p>
    To use the development server, simply run <code>npm start</code> or <code>yarn start</code>
    and point your browser to <code>localhost:8080</code>. If you need to proxy api
    requests to a backend server, see <code>tasks/serve.js</code> and search for the
    commented <code>proxy</code> block.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you would like to do a development build, but write it to disk rather than use
    the dev server, use <code>npm run dev</code> or <code>yarn dev</code>.
