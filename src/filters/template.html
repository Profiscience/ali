  <p>
    This directory contains files for your knockout-punches <a href="https://mbest.github.io/knockout.punches/#text-filters">filters</a>.
    Filters should be a directory with the filter's name and contain at least an index.js that
    exports the filter function.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example:

    <pre><code>
      filters/
      -- fadeIn/
      ---- index.js
      ---- test.js
      ---- README.md
    </code></pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Make it a best practice to also include a README.md and test.js for your filter
    in the same directory.
  </p>
  <p>
    Filters in this directory will be loaded automatically
  </p>
