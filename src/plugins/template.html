    This directory contains <a href="https://github.com/Profiscience/ko-component-router/blob/next/docs/plugins.md">plugins</a>
    for ko-component-router. Plugins are imported and registered by <code>app.js</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Plugins allow you to define the shape of your views' <code>index.js</code> files.
    By default, we include plugins for component loading, model loading, registering
    nested routes, and creating a <code>ctx.query</code> object. However, plugins
    can be used to extend your view declarations with any number of custom properties.
