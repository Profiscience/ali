    First things first, I'm going to expect that you're familiar with Knockout. You
    don't have to be a guru, but this is <strong>not</strong> a tutorial on Knockout.

  <p>
    "Ali" is merely a colloquial name for the architecture you see here. It is an
    opinionated way of building apps with Knockout that has shown to have great success
    at Profiscience.

    User experience is of utmost importance, and the backbone of Ali — ko-component-router —
    was designed around being able to provide a great experience for both the developer
    and end-user. One example of this is the way that data is loaded in Ali. By virtue of the
    fact that ko-component-router does intelligent execution of middleware, meaning that it will
    deeply execute synchronous and asynchronous middleware <em>before</em> performing a
    navigation, Ali behaves totally synchronously, and completely elimates the need for
    <code>ready</code> or <code>loading</code> observables and <code>if</code> binds wrapping
    your entire view. Instead, one loading animation is handled in global middleware, and
    it is presented until a the page is rendered in one fell swoop when its data is ready.
