    <strong>NOTE</strong> Production builds are turned on by setting <code>NODE_ENV</code>
    to <code>production</code>. Using the scripts fields in <code>package.json</code> does
    this automatically.

  <p>
    In production, vendor code and shared code in <code>web_modules</code> are built into
    <code>vendor.[hash].js</code> and <code>shared.[hash].js</code> "DLL"s. These will both
    be loaded on page load before the app entry. This decreases production build time and
    enables long term caching. In my experience, this approach is much preferable to
    using the CommonsChunkPlugin.
  </p>
  <p>
    JavaScripts, HTML, and SCSS will all be minified, and gzipped assets will be produced
    alongside the regular versions.
  </p>
  <p>
    To build for production, use <code>npm run prod</code> or <code>yarn prod</code>.
