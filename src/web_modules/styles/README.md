# Styles

This directory contains the styles for your app.

Styles are loaded using the style-loader with the useable option. A recommended
configuration with Bulma is included, but styles vary greatly from app to app.

It is recommended to have a `main.scss` file and perform your imports from there,
rather than in `index.js`.

Styles are imported and `use`-d [./index.js](./index.js), which is imported by [app.js](../../app.js).
